###Instructions
This app is used for converting Kinect Studio data file (.xef) to Matlab data file (.mat).
The project is based on the following references:  
-Microsoft.Kinect (You may find it by installing Microsoft Kinect SDK 2.0)  
-Microsoft.Kinect.Tools (You may also find it by installing Microsoft Kinect SDK 2.0)  
-MATWriter (Written by SergentMT, which you may find here: http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/819613/Kinect-Version-Depth-Frame-to-mat-File-Exporter)  

###Notes:
It seems that this app only works on x64 platforms in debug mode   

###How-to-use:
Simply run xef2mat.exe, select the .xef file by clicking on the 'select' button. The output files will be at the same folder of the app.
